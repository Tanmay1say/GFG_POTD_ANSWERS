Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minOperation()
which accepts an integer N and return number of minimum operations required to reach N from 0.
Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106

Answer :

class Solution:
    def minOperation(self, n):
        count = 0
        while n > 0:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n = n // 2
            else:
                n -= 1
            count += 1
        return count
