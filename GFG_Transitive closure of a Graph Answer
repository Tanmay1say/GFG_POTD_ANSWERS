Task no.3 You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to 
complete the function transitiveClosure() which takes an integer N and a 
2D array graph(adjacency matrix of the graph) as input parameters 
and returns the transitive closure of the graph in the form of 2D array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N3)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100  

class Solution:
    def transitiveClosure(self,N,graph):
        reach=[[-1 for i in range(N)] for i in range(N)]
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                if i == j:
                    reach[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    reach[i][j] = graph[i][j]
        for k in range(N):
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(N):
                    reach[i][j] = (reach[i][j])or(reach[i][k] and reach[k][j])
        return reach
