Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function checkKthbit that takes n and k as parameters and returns either true(if kth bit is set) or false(if kth bit is not set).

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
0 ≤ K ≤ 31

Answer :-

class Solution:
    
    #Function to check if Kth bit is set or not.
    def checkKthBit(self, n, k):
        if n & (1 << k):
            return True
        else:
            return False
